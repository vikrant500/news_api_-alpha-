# News Headlines Project

This project provides a simple Python script to fetch top news headlines for a given country using the News API.

## Features

- Fetches top news headlines for a specified country.

## Steps to run locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikrant500/news_api_-alpha-.git
```
2. Make sure you have the 'requests' packages installed, to install that, type in terminal

```bash
pip install requests
```
3. make sure you get your own api key from newsAPI. Make a user ID and then get a key.
   Then use that key in the 'get_news' function.

   ```python
   def get_news(country, api_key = 'a'):
   ```
